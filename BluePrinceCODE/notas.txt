In this quiet house of shifting halls, your mission is simple: gather what has been scattered.
The path won’t be straight.

If hunger calls, drift through the **Kitchen**, where warmth never truly sleeps.
Should boredom creep in, the **Parlor** will gladly keep your mind busy.
When the air grows heavy, step into the **Garden** and let the breeze remind you you’re alive.
If you need a moment of calm, the **Boudoir** welcomes you with soft whispers.
Memories lurk deep in the **Krumpus Room**, waiting for those brave enough to enter.
Clues rest quietly in the **Archives**, but they reveal themselves only to patient eyes.
And don’t forget—the keys you’ll need are still in the **Garage**.

Find what belongs to you.
The house will guide you… if you listen.
